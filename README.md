# Web-Game-Othello

Welcome to my first milestone project, a web game!
This is a board game called othello, or reversi
Rules: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reversi

Summary of rules:
A two player game, each choosing a color between black and white.
Four pieces in the center of an 8x8 slot board, two black and two white, across from eachother diagonally.
The player with the black piece goes first, and then alternates
The player is to sandwich the opponents color pieces with their own, vertically, horizontally, or diagonally, and all the peices in between are flipped to their own color
The player with the most color of their own wins

This is a game I have played for a decent amount of time as a child.
I know the rules quite well and figured the logic behind it can be implemented via programming.

Most of the language used is javascript, for the function, some css for looks, and the main page being html.

The game funcitonality should be working as intended.
