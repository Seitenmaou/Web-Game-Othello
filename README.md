# Web-Game-Othello

Welcome to my first milestone project! A web game!
Nothing (too) fancy, but it works!

This is a board game called othello or reversi!
Info and Rules
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reversi

This board game was my favorite as a child.
This was my go-to game before i came across video games.
And figured the game logic can be replicated in programming.

The website is html, css for looks, javascript for functionality.

The functions in game should work as intended.
